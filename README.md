# Wordle UNHINGED.
⭐ This is a project in collaboration with @architaagr for ACM-PESU ECC's ProgChamp. 

Welcome to wordle but UNHINGED. You have 6 tries to figure out a secret word from the given categories. The letters in the right position light up in green, and you get a count of the letters that are present at a different position in the secret word. But here's the catch- you wont know which letters those are.

TL;DR this is wordle having cool modes to pick from and without yellow letters.

Happy playing!

(P.S. This app is already deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud as https://wordle-unhinged.streamlit.app/)
